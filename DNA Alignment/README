# PS5: DNA Alignment

## Description
Try to find the optimnal alignment with the lowest cost between 2 dna

### Features
I used a one vector of ints to store them as a mtrix. 

### Issues
There are 5 tests I am not passing on gradescope

### Extra Credit
None


## Analysis

### Example
Do one additional test case by hand. It should be constructed in such a way that you know the correct  output before running your program on it, and it should be a "corner case" that helps check if your program handles all special situations correctly. 

Please list:
 - a copy of the test case input
 - the expected test case output
 - whether your program ran correctly on it or not
 - optionally, any other remarks

### Specs
